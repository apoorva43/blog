This is a blog post outlining how AI can be used to detect and monitor neurological and mental health conditions much earlier than waiting on a formal diagnosis from healthcare professionals. 

#### Introduction

Healthcare is often reactive: treatment begins only after the symptoms appear.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity to detect these conditions earlier, enabling interventions before the disease progresses.
