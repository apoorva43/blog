    "text": "This is a blog post outlining how AI can be used to detect and monitor neurological and mental health conditions much earlier than waiting on a formal diagnosis from healthcare professionals.\n\nIntroduction\nHealthcare is often reactive: treatment begins only after the symptoms appear. For neurological and mental health conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, depression or anxiety, this delay can significantly affect outcomes, quality of life and treatment effectiveness. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity to detect these conditions earlier, enabling interventions before the disease progresses.\n\n\n\nBrain with AI"
